# About Me!

My name is B███ Salinas.

I graduated from [St. Edward's University](https://www.stedwards.edu/) with a math degree and I was a D-student the entire time — with the transcripts to [prove it](/2019-05-Salinas-UnofficialTranscript.pdf). 

> I've never been any good at math, but once you've seen the invisible threads that's holding everything together, you can't unsee it. It is divinely and chaotically beautiful.

I was a research and teaching assistant throughout college and spent my summers working for [BEAM](https://www.beammath.org/). After I graduated, I was lost and working in local goverment. COVID-19 shut the world down and I re-evaluated (thankfully, I had looked into software engineering bootcamps when I first started with the County). I ended up academically failing out of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) on week 24 of 24. 

I learned _a lot_ during those 10-months.

> These were my projects at App Academy:
> + 1st Group Project: [Veni, Vidi, Voravi](https://github.com/rsdimatulac/Veni-Vidi-Voravi) with [S.S.](https://github.com/ssmall1), [R.D.](https://github.com/rsdimatulac), and [D.K.](https://github.com/hye-kim)
> + 1st Solo Project: [SoundTrack](https://github.com/B-Salinas/SoundTrack)
> + 2nd Group Project: [thrifTEE](https://github.com/vmeduri1/thrifTEE) with [V.M.](https://github.com/vmeduri1), [J.C.](https://github.com/Jc-008), and [N.O.](https://github.com/natoh19)
> + Final/Capstone Solo Project: [YGO Duel Academy Deck Builder](https://github.com/B-Salinas/YGO-Duel-Academy-Deck-Builder)

# Experience
Since then, I've held jobs in:
+ Insurance
+ Finances + Wealth Management
+ Real Estate
+ Start Ups
+ Big Tech Companies
+ Food Industry
+ Customer Service

Here's a short run down of my latest positions.

> I was hit with both the 2022 and 2023 Layoffs in Tech. That really shook my spirit for a minute.

I'm grateful for every job I've held and what each position has taught me.
